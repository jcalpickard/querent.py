March 2025. Maria, an environmental researcher from Barcelona, is 
attending a three-day conference on degrowth in Girona. After a 
long day of presentations and workshops, she unpacks her 
conference materials, spreading them across the dressing table in 
the bedroom of her shared Airbnb. From within a sheaf of papers, a 
small card falls to the floor. Picking it up, she notes a QR code, 
and the text:

	"Querent: A different way of knowing."

```
System: "Through gaps in the ceiling you glimpse..."
> The conference centre's harsh fluroescent lights
System: "The cathedral resonates with [fluroescent lights], while 
[forgotten coffee cups] shape its forms. The [hum of air conditioning] 
moves through its spaces."
```

A simple terminal command creates a local instance. ((How 
comfortable is she, as an environmental researcher, when working 
in the terminal?)) But Maria still needs to procure a tarot deck.

...

((System could store a basic JSON/YAML file of known esoteric 
bookshops and vendors. No external API calls required. Location 
could be manually configured during setup. Check vendor opening 
hours against current time.))

"Before we continue, you'll need a tarot deck for our work 
together. Take your time - your deck will be a companion in this 
practice."

...

((CATHEDRAL as container. WHEEL as navigator. HOMEOSTAT as regulator.))

System: "What object nears you hold meaning?"
> Conference badge
System: "What's temporary or fleeting?"
> Sound of bin lorries
System: "What's always present in this space?"
> Ornate desk lamp

TEMPORAL LAYERS:

- Current: Hotel room reading
- Conference: Three-day conference event
- Seasonal: Autumn equinox
- Long-term: Potential for sustained practice

SETTLING.

System: "Take a moment to settle into this space."

. .

> I'm thinking about scale and limits, how to make things smaller

((Low intensity, moderate complexity, low dispersal -> shift to 
EXPANDING))

EXPANDING.

System: "What other aspects feel alive?"

. . .

> There's something about time ... the conference talks about 
> slowing down, but my research requires deadlines, outputs, 
> meetings

((Increasing complexity, rising intensity, growing dispersal -> 
shift to CONTAINING))

CONTAINING

System: "[ something about time... ]"

. . . .

> Maybe it's about different kinds of time, seasonal time vs. 
> project time?

EMERGING

System: "What shape does this question take?"

> How can I align my research rhythms with natural cycles while 
> still meeting institutional requirements?

...

System: "Your question carries traces of both [conference time] 
and [seasonal time]

. . . . .

System: "Take a moment to prepare your space and deck."

((Maybe more specific guidance required? Maybe not.))

. . . . .

System: "When you're ready, we'll explore your question through 
the cards."

...

THREE-CARD SPREAD:

┌─────┐  ┌─────┐  ┌─────┐ 
│     │  │     │  │     │ 
│  1  │--│  2  │--│  3  │
│     │  │     │  │     │ 
└─────┘  └─────┘  └─────┘ 
 Anchor   Tide    Horizon

System: "Draw three cards, one for each position, placing them 
from left to right."

>> ANCHOR (foundation/present)
>> TIDE (movement/process)
>> HORIZON (potential/emergence)

. . .

System: "What strikes you first about these cards?"
