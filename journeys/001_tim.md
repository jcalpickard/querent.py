Greetings traveller, what is your query?

> How do I finish my PhD?

Take your Tarot Desk and shuffle and cut

....

Take a few seconds to pause and set your intention

.....

Are you happy with your query, or would you like to rephrase?

(How do I finish my Phd?)> How do I even start my PhD

Ok, now draw three cards and place them face down in a horizontal line in 
front of you.
0
Consider the cards for a minute

.....

What are your first impressions? are there any details that jump out at 
you?

> There's a happy little dog chasing the guy

That's great! Now tell me what the three cards are.

Card 1 (Past) > The Fool 
Card 2 (Present) > The Heirophant 
Card 3 (Future)> The Magician

Sit tight for a minute while I consider. In the meantime have a think i 
about what other details of the cards jump out to you.

..................

The Fool suggests someone beginning their journey (in your case, your 
phd), with enthusisam, but also with a certain naivity, and maybe suggests 
risk - he's tiptoing along the edge of a precipice. The happy little dog 
is by his side, and cheering him on, but maybe also enabling him a bit?

In the present, we have the heirophant. An authority figure, but also a a 
teacher, and a gateway to hidden (or forbidden) knowledge. However the 
heirophant is also a figure of tradition, archaicness, patriarchy, it's 
possible that you're in conflict with someone with either inflexible or 
outdated attitudes, and this is frustrating your sense of progress.

You mentioned "beginning again" when you rephrased the query, and this is 
very i germane. in the last position we have "The Magician", the second 
arcana, so still at the beginning of the fool's journey, and as such might 
represent starting afresh. Nothing ever truly begins from scratch however 
- the magician is someone assured and confident, who has all his tools at 
his disposal and a mastery of them. To me this suggests you've grown and 
learnt from your frustrations in the present and are ready to move on from 
them with renewed abilities and confidence.

Alternatively, the magician could be someone you meet along the way, with 
these qualities, who will help you along your journey.

Take a sec to let that digest. How does that sound? Any thoughts?

........

(Press enter twice when you're done)> What's the dog's name?

That's an interesting question. I guess if a specific person comes to mind 
who takes that role for you, try using their name and see how it fits. If 
noone comes to mind, we'll call him "pepper".

> 

Do you want an extra card on top of any of the three to expand on the 
reading? Choose wisely, you can only have one!

(Press 1, 2 or 3 for a card, or 0 for none)> 2

Ok, think about your main questions about "THE PRESENT" and the role of 
the figure of the heirophant in it, for a second.

....

Now draw another card, place it on top of the heirophant, partially 
obscuring it, and tell me what it is:

> The Tower.

Before I give you an interpretation, have a think about the tower, 
anything that leaps out to you about it, and how it relates to the 
heirophant.

.....

> There's two figures falling from the windows

Aha, it's funny you noticed that, i was going to say the same thing! The 
Tower represents a moment of tumultuous change, which is often painful, 
and I think this reflects your doubts about whether you're truly finishing 
your PhD or beginnng it again. The two figures to me suggest that noone 
has come away from this situation unchanged - neither yourself, nor anyone 
you've been in i relation with up to this point in your PhD journey. If 
anyone in particular reminds you of the heirophant, the other figure might 
represent them.

This might sound scary and disastrous, but it's not. The imagery of the 
tower card features two different ideas of growth, the regimented, 
hierarchical, vertical construction of the tower itself, and the emergent, 
horizantal growth of the garden below. More than anything you're being set 
free from a confining situation and released into an environment where you 
can grow more freely, and more than one person will experience this 
liberation as a result of your journey so far.

Take a sec to reflect....

....

Any final reflections you'd like to add before we close the session? I'll 
store them to refer to in the future

(Press enter twice to skip)> I hope the dog didn't fall out of the tower 
too.

Thank you for your patience and insight. I'll be here next time you have a 
question.

Take a moment to thank the cards, reshuffle them and return them to the deck.
