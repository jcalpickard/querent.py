# Querent.py

Querent.py is an experimental software tool for personal tarot practice, supporting introspection and exploration through card-based reflection. This Python-based system incorporates both pre-populated traditional card meanings and user-generated interpretations, allowing for the evolution of card meanings over time. It requires a physical tarot deck, using card draws as triggers for retrieving and generating information.

## **Key features:**

- Local, single-user deployment supporting situated knowledges and personal practice
- Emphasis on introspection and exploration over prediction
- Support with inputing drawn spreads
- Not a static encoding of fixed meanings, but a tool for exploring associations and generative potential
- Ability to supplement traditional tarot meanings with user-supplied notes and interpretations
- Variable data persistence, with the user populating a knowledge base through sustained interaction

## Theoretical framework

- Ian Bogost's concepts of "philosophical carpentry" and "procedural rhetoric"
- Alejandro Jodorowky's ideas of the tarot as a "projective instrument", "nomadic cathedral", or "portable contemplative device"
- Explorations of "ostensive detachment" and "black-boxing" in knowledge practices
- Critical engagement with the presuppositions of large language models and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) systems

## Usage

(Note: Detailed usage instructions to be added as the project develops)

## Project context

Querent.py is part of a broader research initiative, "Xamota," using reflexive software development to explore the intersections of intuitive, embodied knowledge and structured data schemas. This project is being developed in collaboration with [@timcowlishaw](https://github.com/timcowlishaw) as part of our sprawling, collaborative Python-for-ethnography skill exchange, "[Enxaneta](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta)." 

**Related projects:**

- [Humus](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/humus): A "composting" database that forgets things, developed by Tim Cowlishaw.

While Querent.py focuses on tarot practice and intuitive knowledge retrieval, Humus explores concepts of information persistence and decay. Together, these programmes form a tiny experimental software ecosystem, exploring alternative approaches to data management, knowledge representation, and software development in ethnographic research contexts.

## Contribution

This project is currently in a closed development phase. However, we welcome forks and discussions about the project's concepts, implementation, and implications for personal tarot practice. ðŸŽ´
