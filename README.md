# Querent.py: A Python tool for personal tarot practice

Querent.py is an experimental software tool for tarot practice. This Python-based system incorporates both pre-populated traditional card meanings and user-generated interpretations, allowing for the evolution of card meanings over time. It requires a physical tarot deck, using card draws as triggers for retrieving and generating information.

Querent.py is part of "Xamota," some research on structured data and inuitive knowledge I'm doing with [@timcowlishaw](https://github.com/timcowlishaw), as part of our sprawling mutual-aid Python-for-ethnography skill exchange, "[Enxaneta](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta)." While I work on Querent.py, Tim will be developing [Humus](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/humus), a "composting" database that forgets things.

**Key features:**

- Local, single-user deployment supporting situated knowledges and personal practice
- Emphasis on introspection and exploration over prediction
- Support with inputing drawn spreads
- Not a static encoding of fixed meanings, but a tool for exploring associations and generative potential
- Ability to supplement traditional tarot meanings with user-supplied notes and interpretations
- Variable data persistence, with the user populating a knowledge base through sustained interaction

## Theoretical framework

- Ian Bogost's concepts of "philosophical carpentry" and "procedural rhetoric"
- Alejandro Jodorowky's ideas of the tarot as a "nomadic cathedral" or "portable contemplative device"
- Explorations of "ostensive detachment" and "black-boxing" in knowledge practices
- Critical engagement with the presuppositions of large language models and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) systems

## Usage

(Note: Detailed usage instructions to be added as the project develops)
