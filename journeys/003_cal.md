How to offer (fractal) depth without breaking flow? Optional layers, 
complexity remains hidden until requested. Clear escape hatches. 
Structure mirroring across levels; "as above, so below."

Structure versus poetry? Need to hinge legible computational structures, 
state markers, with poetics and atmosphere, evocation rather than 
categorisation.

Pattern hints with querent override?

States as containers for emotional states, intuitive knowledge.

```
[^] Upright
[R] Reversed
```

Timestamps for input. Simple markdown files with semantic markers (?).

Pattern files for recognition? Pattern tags? Environmental markers? 
Relationship indicators? State markers?

Minimal but atmospheric, poetic CLI. Pace-setting through typography, 
rhythm. Clear state indicators. Optional depth at every point of the 
interaction (fractal?).
